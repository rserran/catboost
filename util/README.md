# Coding style

Style guide for the util folder is a stricter version of
[general style guide](https://docs.yandex-team.ru/arcadia-cpp/cpp_style_guide)
(mostly in terms of ambiguity resolution).

 * all {} must be in K&R style
 * &, * tied closer to a type, not to variable
 * always use `using` not `typedef`
 * even a single line block must be in braces {}:
   ```
   if (A) {
       B();
   }
   ```
 * _ at the end of private data member of a class - `First_`, `Second_`
 * every .h file must be accompanied with corresponding .cpp to avoid a leakage and check that it is self contained
 * prohibited to use `printf`-like functions


Things declared in the general style guide, which sometimes are missed:

 * `template <`, not `template<`
 * `noexcept`, not `throw ()` nor `throw()`, not required for destructors
 * indents inside `namespace` same as inside `class`


Requirements for a new code (and for corrections in an old code which involves change of behaviour) in util:

 * presence of UNIT-tests
 * presence of comments in Doxygen style
 * accessors without Get prefix (`Length()`, but not `GetLength()`)

This guide is not a mandatory as there is the general style guide.
Nevertheless if it is not followed, then a next `ya style .` run in the util folder will undeservedly update authors of some lines of code.

Thus before a commit it is recommended to run `ya style .` in the util folder.


Don't forget to run tests from folder `tests`: `ya make -t tests`

**Note:** tests are designed to run using `autocheck/` solution.

# Submitting a patch

In order to make a commit, you have to get approval from one of
[util](https://arcanum.yandex-team.ru/arc/trunk/arcadia/groups/util) members.

If no comments have been received withing 1â€“2 days, it is OK
to send a graceful ping into [Igni et ferro](https://wiki.yandex-team.ru/ignietferro/) chat.

Certain exceptions apply. The following trivial changes do not need to be reviewed:

* docs, comments, typo fixes,
* renaming of an internal variable to match the styleguide.

Whenever a breaking change happens to accidentally land into trunk, reverting it does not need to be reviewed.
